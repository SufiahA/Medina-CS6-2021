      <p> The Seatle Spaceneedle is one of the most famous land marks in Washington,and is also one of the coolest places.At it's height of 605 feet tall, you can go all the way to the top and
     and if you look at the floor, which is made out of glass, you can see all of Seatle under your feet<p/>

       <p> Sammamish lake is one of my personal favorites because, there are so many things in sammamish park that add up to a great experience, like the lake, the beach,the trees, basically everything.
           if you are someone who likes being around nature, i recommend you go there.<p/>

        <img src="glass.jpg" alt="Image description" />
       <p> The Chuhily museum is one of the most breathtaking museums in Washington and has some of the most mesmerizing art i have ever seen. and it is located very close to 
           the Space needle and out side of the museum is a garden, but instead of real plants they are made out of glass<p/>
        <h2> Snowqualmie Falls<h2/>
         <img src="falls.jpeg" alt="Image description" />
        <p> Snowqualmie Falls is a very popular tourist area. it has a very beautiful view and even though you cant see it from up close, you can still admire it's beauty from far away.
           The best time to go there is in the summer, when the waterfall is at it's fullest<p/>
