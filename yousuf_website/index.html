      <p>Cats are amazing jumpers they can climb into high trees. They are a really good pet to have because, they are cute and very calm pets and they can really do everything themself.</p>
     
    <p> Cats can clean themself so you dont have to clean them. However, if they are an outdoor cat you have to clean them, because they could have ticks and fleas all over them that can kill them. But if the cat is an indoor cat then it is okay.</p>
    
       <p>There are a lot of different types of cat breeds. Some cats are turkish van, tabby, ragdoll, calico, and sphynx. Some people like different types of cats that you may haven't had before but you think it is ugly. </p>

    <p>I have a type of cat that is called a turkish van. She is a rare cat, and she is also playful. Sometimes I will go to bed and my cat will cuddle with me. A good part about my cat is that she doesn't whine as much as other cats.
