  <li>	Kunafa: cut the kunafa in small pieces, mix it with the melted butter (mix it very well), get the pan, and put a small amount of butter on the pan so the qunafa doesn’t stick. Put half of the quanfa pack, then add all the filling (do not mix).Then put the other half of the kunafa over the filling and put it in the oven on 350 Fahrenheit for 30 minutes-1 hour. Keep checking on it and take it out when it's a golden color. Once it’s ready, take it out of the oven and put it in a plate or any hard surface.(Lastley add the syrup the qunafa is hot so the syrup cools it down)</li>
