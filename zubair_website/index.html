<p>When you visit the west side of the U.S you should visit these places. I've visited all of them. They are amazing places in my opinion.</p>
<h2>Washington</h2>

  <p>This is the Space Needle. It is located in Seattle Washington. It is a very popular place to visit. It has an observation deck 520 feet above the ground. The top floor also has a restaurant. It also has a gift shop at the bottom. Some of the floors of the Space Needle rotates. One floor even has a glass bottom. </p>

  <p>This beautiful place is Mount Rainier National Park. Mount Rainier is the tallest mountain in the state. This is the perfect place for you if you like hiking, fishing, or camping. You can visit Reflection Lake and you can camp there. If you don't like camping then you can stay at inns. Hiking through the trails is fun. Visiting with your friend's and family makes the trip even more fun.</p>
  <h2>Oregon</h2>
  <h3>Tillamook Cheese Factory</h3>

  <p>The Tillamook Cheese Factory is a place you need to see if you are in Oregon. You will love this place if you love food. As the name says they make cheese there. They have a tour showing how the cheese is made. They also have samples of the cheese. The part I love the most is the icecream store. They have every flavor you can think of and probably even more.<p>
  <h3>Crater Lake</h3>

  <p>This is Crater Lake. It is the deepest lake in the US. It was made by a volcano. There are gift shops, inns, and restaurants near the lake. There are also campgrounds near the lake. You could go to one of the viewpoints to take pictures of the lake. This is the place to go to relax and have fun.</p>
  <h2>California</h2>
  <h3>Golden Gate Bridge</h3>

  <p>Just take a relaxing drive on this bridge. You will love it. The bridge is a famous place throughout the country. You can get some amazing pictures here. Just take a drive here at sunset after a long day of sightseeing.</p>
  <h3>Catalina Island</h3>

  <p> This is Catalina Island, my favorite place on the list. I've been here with my friends a while ago. You get there by ferry from Newfound Beach to the island. We stayed at a house we rented. On the island they have stores, houses for rent, icecream parlors, and much more. There are ziplines, and there is even scuba diving. There is also a boat where you go below deck and look through windows to see underwater. This is a place I want to go back to and you probably will want to go back after your first time</p>
